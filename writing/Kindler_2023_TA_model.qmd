## Target journals

[I'm not paying attention to a target journal for now. This section is a collection of my thoughts] \ \

A journal that is interested in "process evaluations, early results, and feasibility/pilot studies of digital interventions" would be ideal for us (e.g. JMIR Formative Research (medical only?)). \ \

Our **primary** option is [Royal Society Journals such as Interface Focus](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsfs):
- > Reports - Reports are short, letters-style contributions of no more than 2500 words, (including references and figure captions) and up to four displays (i.e. figures and tables), of which no more than two should be figures. These articles are published rapidly and preliminary and more speculative work of high quality is strongly encouraged.
- My understanding of letter-style is that a Discussion section is morphed into Results or non-existent?

## Abstract

**Background:** Many Australians experience a feeling of being connected to nature and want more action to conserve biodiversity. Australian governments have delivered inadequate policy interventions to curb losses. Science communication combined with public sphere activism can play a role in encouraging governments to instigate improved policy.

**Objective:** This paper describes the development, implementation and preliminary impact of the Threatened Australians (TA) web app that aimed to encourage policy change . By capitalising on availability of data, The app aimed to encourage policy change through broad engagement and explicitly connecting scientific information to political implications and actions

**Methods:** To create a user-friendly product and reach target users a collaborative multidisciplinary partnership was formed to build the app over a 15-week period. Informal knowledge was used to guide the development. Usage data was collected through web analytics. Survey/feedback data was collected through a form comprised of four free-text and two likert scale questions. Data was limited to a six week period following the launch.

**Results:**

* What is the total number of users the app received?
* What do the results of the feedback form say?
* How do users compare across time and with media events?
* How many events occurred on the district page?
* Which districts experienced the highest number of events?
* How many events occurred on the How-to-help page?
* How many people clicked the email your MP link?
* What was the conversion rate of user to email MP link clicks?
* Which species received the most engagement/events?

**Discussion:**

The strengths of our approach and the app are:

* Innovative idea
* A relatively low resource (time and money) budget, economical and pragmatic
* Rapid development

The limitations our approach and the app are:

* Small usage/sample sizes
* Limited behaviour change expertise
* Limited measurement and evaluation framework
* Accuracy of public threatened species data is dubious (created doubt among app users)
* Using engagement, page views, events as statistics or proxies for PPW

There are several ways to improve our approach to development:

* By using a scientific framework for development (e.g. Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share (IDEAS))
* The aims of the app are conducive to using a behavioural science approach (e.g. the behaviour change wheel)
* Comprehensive testing

**Conclusions:** An ad-hoc approach delivered a functional app that was made in a timely manner. The limitations of our model are readily surmountable with appropriate planning and expertise. The TA app is ready to be revised and built upon. A necessary future direction is evaluating it in an controlled/uncontrolled, quantitative study.

# Introduction

Biodiversity loss is among the most pressing environmental crises of our time. Characterized by a rapid decline in species and the degradation of ecosystems, it has dire implications for the health and resilience of human/non-human/more-than-human world. Many Australians feel connected to nature and are aware of the need for increased action to conserve biodiversity [@borgBiodiversityConcernsReport2023]. However, despite this public sentiment, the policy responses from Australian governments have been insufficient at curbing losses and improving the outlook [@evansReconceptualizingRoleScience2021; @williamsFutureRoleConservation2020; @roseMajorBarriersEvidenceinformed2018; @australiannationalauditofficeManagementThreatenedSpecies2022; @samuelIndependentReviewEPBC2020a; @resideHowSendFinch2019]. Engaging the public in politically-relevant ways, such as facilitating communication with local elected representatives, may tip the scales in favor of more effective policy intervention [@toomeyNavigatingSpaceResearch2017; @nielsenBiodiversityConservationPromising2021]. Conservation movement has neglected behaviour change aimed at creating system level change.
\ \
The challenges to instigate policy change for biodiversity conservation are multifaceted. They span from individual-level factors such as awareness and knowledge, to community-level factors including societal norms, values, attitudes, behaviours, collective action, and systemic issues like political will and funding. Although it is clear what needs to change, for example, deep transformation of the food system [@leclereBendingCurveTerrestrial2020], how to catalyse these changes is more difficult. The interplay between individual-level (e.g., knowledge and motivation), community-level (e.g., socio-political climate), and societal-level factors (e.g., legal and policy frameworks) all likely impact the pace and direction of policy change.
\ \
Web applications (apps) present an opportunity to address this complexity, fostering individual and collective actions towards policy change. For instance, smartphones are ubiquitous [@vromenPoliticalEngagementAustralian], interactive, and can deliver information in an engaging and tailored way, providing immediate feedback. A user-centred experience can foster long-term engagement and success with initiatives. Therefore, web-based apps have the potential to be effective tools for influencing policy change, offering a cost-effective and scalable method to reach and engage a broad audience. However, the development of these interventions must be guided by sound scientific knowledge and theory. Given this rise in usage (and data availability), opportunity for voices to be represented in politics is greater than ever before [@vromenPoliticalEngagementAustralian]. Given the accessibility of digital technology \[although many Aussies don't have access?\], offering a platform for engagement in the crisis is important [@jolyMultimediaToolsApplications2018].
\ \
The recent surge in development of smartphone applications targeting various societal issues (e.g. change.org, iNaturalist, eBird) is noteworthy [@jolyMultimediaToolsApplications2018]. However, many of these applications lack scientific foundation, evidence-based strategies, or rigorous evaluation. Despite these shortcomings, their popularity suggests they possess substantial reach, at least in the short term. The conservation movement has neglected building apps that focus on building broad scale awareness while being oriented to political change [@whitelawBiodiversityDataPublic2021].

## Objective/aims

In response to these challenges, we deployed an ad-hoc web-app, called "Threatened Australians" (threatened.org.au, TA) as means to experiment with adapting conservation research/efforts as a social/digital intervention. The Threatened Australians web-app operates at the interface between data-driven/science serving (typically, citizen science) platforms and political/social activism. It is the first attempt by a multidisciplinary team to provide an accessible and engaging web application aimed at raising public attention around the species crisis in Australia. The web-app was timed for release prior to the 2022 Australian federal election to raise attention as a electoral issue, which was seen as lacking from the platforms of the major parties [@coxWorstItEver2022]. In this paper, we describe:

1. Our design and development process
2. Analysis of the analytics and feedback data collected
3. Results of the analysis and how they inform future iterations

# Methods

## Ethics approval

This project has been reviewed by the Research Ethics and Integrity and is deemed to be exempt from ethics review under the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research and relevant University of Queensland policy (PPL 4.20.07).

## Design and development

Threatened Australians (TA) is available as a web app at a domain (threatened.org.au) through browser applications on mobile, desktop, and tablet. Development of the app begun once the core information was decided upon and gathered (see Folder SX for methodology and data information). The design of TA took on a multidisciplinary approach with regular evaluations. The development was led by a conservation science doctorate student with counsel from a conservation science professor, an interaction design expert, and a web developer. The team held an initial workshop with scientists/campaigners/organisers/strategisers from Australian environmental non-governmental organisations (eNGOs) (WWF, TNC, Invasives Species Council, Birdlife, Bush Heritage, ACF, Queensland Conservation Council) and multiple academics to receive feedback on the idea and process. This initial workshop and subsequent discussions confirmed the decision on the core function of the app. During the design and development phase, the team held meetings to describe the vision and reassess design decisions. Once developed to a functional stage, the team held content and functionality testing workshops with three eNGOs (WWF, BirdLife, ACF) and a design workshop with experts from that field conducive to beta testing. Based on the feedback received, the app was re-designed to accommodate requests and advice. Alpha testing of the app did not occur.

On initial visit to the app, users were presented with the home page which asked for their postcode. The app would assign the user to the electorate the input postcode was local to. The user would see a species whose range intersects with the CED alongside information about that species such as its threats and geographic range. The user could cycle through the list of species associated with that CED or continue on to the how to help page. The how to help page identifies four key ways that a constituent or Australian citizen could assist threatened species within that region. Other functions of TA included a Resource, a Browse (electorates), an About, and Feedback pages.

The target behaviour for the app was defined as engaging with four actions: 1) Emailing the local representative; 2) Connecting with organisations dedicated to the cause; 3) Voting for aligned representatives; and 4) Sharing the issue within social networks.

## Deployment and media

Accompanying the live version of the app was a media release, which was sent out to Australian local and international media outlets. Accompanying the release date (02/05/22) was a 'The Conversation" article along with efforts being made via social media to promote TA. The app creators personally messaged organisations and networks of interest asking for air time on their platforms.

## Data collection

We generated data from two sources: passive analytics from usage and a opt-in survey of perceived experience. Usage data was collected by embedded Google Analytics 4 on the web app during a X week period from X date to X date. Analytics data reflected usage based on the following X indicators: (1) Page views and titles, (2) Acquisition of users, (3) X something else, (4) demographics. Survey data came from a form positioned in the header of the web app (Fig X) and was comprised of four free-text answers and two likert \[?\] scale questions. We filtered out the free-text questions (not enough volume, and kinda random responses, Supplementary Material S\* \[for full table of Q/A\]), and present the quantitative answers to the following questions: Q1 "Are you going to take any actions as a result of using the web app?"; Q2 "The information on this website was easy to understand:".

Information on media reach/other things from Dom Jarvis Media reach from conversation article data

## Analysis

Google Analytics data was subset to be between the 2022/05/02 and 2022/06/14.Descriptive statistics of usage etc were used to... All analyses were conducted using R and X packages.

# Results

```{r import, include=FALSE}
data_nonspatial <- load_json_data()

data_spatial <- load_spatial_data()
```

## Survey results

```{r}
data_nonspatial$feedback_clean <- transform_feedback(data_nonspatial$feedback_clean)

data_nonspatial$feedback_actions_result <- make_feedback_actions_result(data_nonspatial$feedback_clean['actions_result'])

data_nonspatial$feedback_easy_to_understand <- make_feedback_easy_to_understand(data_nonspatial$feedback_clean['easy_to_understand'])
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(data_nonspatial$feedback_actions_result)
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(data_nonspatial$feedback_easy_to_understand)
```

We received 35 responses on the survey found at the feedback link on the header of the app. 40% of users who answered the form said they were going to take actions as a result of using the app. 43% said they were either probably, that they would not or were unsure of whether they would. 60% of survey form answers either agreed or strongly agreed that the information found on the app was easy to understand.

## Usage results

### How did media events relate to usage statistics?

* What is the total number of users the app received?

```{r}
data_nonspatial$acquis_time_sum <- make_acquis_time_sum(data_nonspatial$acquis_time_clean)

data_nonspatial$acquis_time_source <- make_acquis_time_source(data_nonspatial$acquis_time_clean)
```

The TA web application was launched on the 3rd May 2022 ahead of the Australian federal election held on the 21st May 2022. Prior to election day, `r data_nonspatial$acquis_time_sum %>% filter(between(date, as.Date("2022-05-02"), as.Date("2022-05-21"))) %>% summarise(sum = sum(sum))` (`r data_nonspatial$acquis_time_sum %>% filter(between(date, as.Date("2022-05-02"), as.Date("2022-05-21"))) %>% summarise((sum = sum(sum))/(data_nonspatial$acquis_time_sum %>% summarise(sum = sum(sum)))*100) %>% round()`%) users visited the web app (Figure \ref(fig:user-time)). The largest acquisition source of users were from `r data_nonspatial$acquis_time_source %>% select(source) %>% slice(1)` input of the TA URL into a web browser application (`r data_nonspatial$acquis_time_source %>% select(total) %>% slice(1)`, `r data_nonspatial$acquis_time_source %>% select(total_percent) %>% slice(1)`%). The Australian Broadcasting Corporation accounted for `r data_nonspatial$acquis_time_source %>% select(total) %>% slice(2)` (`r data_nonspatial$acquis_time_source %>% select(total_percent) %>% slice(2)`%) users, followed by The Conversation with `r data_nonspatial$acquis_time_source %>% select(total) %>% slice(3)` (`r data_nonspatial$acquis_time_source %>% select(total_percent) %>% slice(3)`%), Google with `r data_nonspatial$acquis_time_source %>% select(total) %>% slice(4)` (`r data_nonspatial$acquis_time_source %>% select(total_percent) %>% slice(4)`%), and Facebook `r data_nonspatial$acquis_time_source %>% select(total) %>% slice(5)` (`r data_nonspatial$acquis_time_source %>% select(total_percent) %>% slice(5)`%).

```{r}
#| label: fig-engag-usage-time
#| fig-cap: Time series of Threatened Australians web app usage including key events. Acquisition of users from the corresponding websites (colour) and proportion in relation to total number of users (shaded area).

# TODO: add in key media events, maybe by joining the two datasets, or manual add-in as per Chang 2018

plot_engage_usage_time(data_nonspatial$acquis_time_clean)
```

### How events differentiate spatially and between pages

* How many events occurred on the district page?
* How many events occurred on the How-to-help page?
* What was the conversion rate of user to email MP link clicks?
* Which districts experienced the highest number of events?

```{r include=FALSE}
data_spatial[['species_title_spatial']] <- mk_species_title_spatial(data_spatial$elect_clean, data_nonspatial$species_title_clean)

data_nonspatial[['species_title']] <- data_spatial$species_title_spatial %>%
  st_set_geometry(NULL)
```

An event is defined as a distinct user interaction with the TA web app such as viewing a page, scrolling, and clicking. As species were grouped by division, the CED with the most aggregated events on each species was `r data_nonspatial$species_title %>% arrange(desc(event_count)) %>% select(electorate) %>% slice(1)` (`r data_nonspatial$species_title %>% arrange(desc(event_count)) %>% select(state_territory_abbrev) %>% slice(1)`) with `r data_nonspatial$species_title %>% arrange(desc(event_count)) %>% select(event_count) %>% slice(1)` (Figure \@ref(fig:CED-events)). In comparison, the CED with the least number of events was `r data_nonspatial$species_title %>% arrange(event_count) %>% select(electorate) %>% slice(1)` (`r data_nonspatial$species_title %>% arrange(event_count) %>% select(state_territory_abbrev) %>% slice(1)`) with `r data_nonspatial$species_title %>% arrange(event_count) %>% select(event_count) %>% slice(1)` (Figure \@ref(fig:CED-events)).

```{r}
#| label: fig-CED-events
#| fig-cap: Choropleth map of Australian Commonwealth Electoral Divisions (CEDs) and the aggregate number of events recorded on the species profile pages

# I tried to do by city but this was unsuccessful as it didn't capture a lot, it kinda makes sense to do it via how we structured the app
# Two options:
# A) Could do one chart of sum species page view per electorate then
# B) sum how to help page per electorate

plot_ced_events(data_spatial$species_title_spatial)
```

### How events differentiate between species

* Which species received the most engagement/events?

There were X number of threatened animals. There were X number of threatened plants. Every animal species in every electorate received at least X views. Number of species investigated and most popular species were XXX.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-species-engag
#| tbl-cap: The most engaged with threatened species in the Threatened Australians app

knitr::kable(head(data_nonspatial$species_title_av_time_clean, 10))
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
mk_svg_high_engag_species_map(data_spatial$species_clean)

data_nonspatial[['species_clean']] <- data_spatial$species_clean |>
  st_set_geometry(NULL) |> as_tibble()
```

```{r}
