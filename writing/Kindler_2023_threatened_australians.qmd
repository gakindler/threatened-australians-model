# Abstract

It is essential to increase public awareness of the biodiversity crisis. Whilst scientists, NGOs, and government have developed tools that improve accessibility, they fall short of engaging the broader public. Here we describe the implementation and evaluation of the Threatened Australians (TA) web app, which uses existing data to tell the story of threatened species. By capitalising on recent advances in data, the app aims to communicate localised snapshots of the crisis through electoral districts. Electoral districts offer a means to cultivate political support which is currently lacking. Examining the development, launch, and maintenance of the app helps to inform/improve future efforts.

# Introduction

## Public understanding is lacking and essential

Biodiveristy declining. Science not being translated into change. Key proposed solutions to this are raising awareness.

<!-- Biodiversity is declining at increasingly accelerated rates. While conservation science is just one of the tools to address this problem, it does not have a good track record of translating effort into widespread/transformative change [@evansReconceptualizingRoleScience2021]. Much previously exerted effort within conservation science has been dedicated to describing the state of biodiversity and species and proximate drivers of change [@williamsFutureRoleConservation2020]. However, this information is not being translated into policy/action/change by means of a space existing between research implementation or rather knowledge and action [@toomeyNavigatingSpaceResearch2017]. A key front for improving this space is at the science-policy interface. Key solutions to some of the barriers preventing evidence-informed conservation policy are embedded in "raising awareness among the public and decision-makers regarding the long-term consequences of inaction" (Policy position, Switzerland) [@roseMajorBarriersEvidenceinformed2018]. This solution is poignant in Australia where the broader community and leaders/representatives designate insignificant attention, and consequently actions to the biodiversity crisis. We coin this awareness gap as a "social/political biodiversity crisis". This crisis manifests in that insufficient attention is applied to improving policy and providing the necessary resources to conservation is occurring within Australia. Scientist, and governance reviewers all identify these as significant constraints that we need to break down to improve conservation outcomes [@australiannationalauditoffice2022; @samuel2020; @reside2019].

[@ref our new paper]

JW: On top of a biodiversity crisis, there is a conservation crisis in Australia. There conservation crisis is a lack of conservation attention focussed at the biodiversity crisis. Key references National Audits, Samuel reviews, review and perspective papers by scientists (Reside etc) all show there is a lack of resources and action by leaders. Moreover, and related, there are clear shortfalls in Australians knowing or engaging with the issue. There is a clear need for new models in conservation to catalyse change. -->

## Current efforts of increasing public understanding

Conservation science is not disconnected from communities. It has citizen science. Only target the ecologically minded which is a small portion of the population.

<!-- Whilst, this has all been acknowledged, catalysing change within this space has not been the focus of research [or advocacy efforts?]. Traditional or normal conservation science research undervalues the production of politically motivated social interventions. Conservation science is relatively connected with communities, in the last decade, social networks and digital technology has enabled large communities of citizen science to occur (e.g. iNaturalist, Zooniverse, eBird, iSpot). Citizens have become increasingly aware of the importance of monitoring biodiversity, the why behind it and have leaped at the opportunity to assist [@jolyMultimediaToolsApplications2018]. Yet, these efforts have been criticised [REF] as targeting or only attracting the ecologically minded, and thus a insignificant amount of the general population. Despite conservation being a mission-oriented discipline needing advocates and social-media buy-in, it seems to bereft of social media/digital platforms connecting people to the problem [@whitelawBiodiversityDataPublic2021]. Most public-facing ecology/conservation initiatives are focused on the needs of science (citizen-science) and the dissemination of results to managers (shiny apps), with a lack of focus on inducting broader society into the issue and encouraging advocacy for change. This has created a clear opportunity to build upon these efforts and for conservation science to begin designing models that explicity work towards addressing the barriers that exist at the science-policy interface. -->

## Digital technology as an intervention

Australia has highest rate of social media/smart phone usage in world. Integral part of our lives and expressing political interests. Opportunity to exploit digitech is greatest it has ever been.

<!-- Australia has one of the highest usage rates of social media/smart phone in the world [@vromenPoliticalEngagementAustralian]. Digital engagement is an integral part of young people's lives and their political interests and we know that political and social engagement is more likely to occur via online means [@vromenPoliticalEngagementAustralian]. Although disagreements of the value of digital mediums as an intervention for political engagement remain and the potential for harm/good exist, many groups now use it as a means to communicate stories and activism. Given this rise in usage (and data availability), opportunity for voices to be represented in politics is greater than ever before [@vromenPoliticalEngagementAustralian]. Given the accessibility of digital technology \[although many Aussies don't have access?\], offering a platform for engagement in the crisis is important [@jolyMultimediaToolsApplications2018].

In the current attention market (tech companies, other issues, food/shelter responsibilities \[ref ezra klein poddy\]), we as a conservation community cannot expect a disaffected public to pay attention to an issue without a trade. Story-telling as a device for social change has risen dramatically in the past decades as an effective (?) means to broaden horizons. We must go beyond story-telling and offer a service to capture attention and thus entertain through education, if you must, to hook potential conservationists onto the issue. On the other hand, the conservation movement (\$?) is dwarfed by corporate or other interests (actually how much money does conservation attract compared to other issues/disciplines?).

JW: Much hype around social media and apps to increase attention on social issues. Climate example, health examples? Yet in conservation, despite being a crisis discipline needing advocates, and wider society buy-in, there seems bereft of these social media initiatives connecting people to the problem. Most social media efforts in conservation and ecology has been focussed on the needs of the science (key refs include the papers already sent, we will need others) rather than disseminating the finding to the audience to the general public to advocate for change. -->

## Objective/aims

We deploy an ad-hoc issue-based digital-native organisation, called 'Threatened Australians' (TA) as means to experiment with adapting conservation research/efforts as a social/digital intervention. The Threatened Australians web-app operates at the interface between data-driven/science serving (typically, citizen science) platforms and political/social activism. It is the first attempt by a multidisciplinary team to provide an accessible and engaging web application aimed at raising public attention around the species crisis in Australia. The web-app was founded on aiming to provide a resource that would encourage users to engage with the problem and then offer easy means by which they can 'take action'. The primary action of the web-app was facilitating communication with local federal elected representatives via email, mimicking a tried and tested method of political participation [@vromenPoliticalEngagementAustralian]. The web-app was timed for release prior to the 2022 Australian federal election to raise attention as a electoral issue, which was seen as lacking from the platforms of the major parties [@coxWorstItEver2022]. In this paper, we describe:

1. Our design and development process
2. Analysis of the analytics and feedback data collected
3. Results of the analysis and how they inform future iterations

<!-- We describe the processes involved in the generation and deployment of the prototype. Second, we then provide details of how we collected data around app usage and users perceptions. Third, we synthesise this information to evaluate how it performed in the Australian media/political landscape and across electorates. Finally, we examine models for improving on our approach, its robustness, and future opportunities.

JW: Here we provide a description of one of the first proactive attempts by a multidisciplinary team to provide a web app aimed at raising public attention around the species conservation crisis in Australia. Called "Threatened Australians" (TA), its aim is to raise awareness of the plight of threatened species, specifically there locations and threats. It was linked to post code so to bring get local attention (Refs on need for local action) and timed before the 2022 federal election so as to bring attention specifically around federal politicians. Therefore the key spatial boundaries used were federal electorates. We describe the generation of the prototype and testing methods, public usage of the app once realised and how this varied across different electorates. -->

# Methods

<!-- Key papers: @hendrieImpactMobilePhone2020, -->

## Design and development

<!-- Threatened Australians (TA) is available as a web app at a domain (threatened.org.au) through browser applications on mobile, desktop, and tablet. Once the core information was decided upon, it was gathered (see Folder SX for methodology and data information). Whilst adding and subtracting data sources was a regular occurrence throughout the design of the app and planning and design of the app begun after the core information was ready. The design of TA took on a multidisciplinary approach with regular evaluations. The development was led by a conservation science doctorate student with counsel from a conservation science professor, an interaction design expert, and a web developer. The team held an intial workshop with scientists/campaigners/organisers from Australian conservation eNGOs (WWF, TNC, Invasives Species Council, Birdlife, Bush Heritage, ACF, Queensland Conservation Council) and multiple academics to receive feedback on the idea and process. This initial workshop and subsequent discussions confirmed the decision on the core function of the app. The core goal of TA is to lead users to communicating with elected representatives and connection with environmental groups/nongovernmental organisations (eNGOs). During the design and development phase, the team held meetings to describe the vision and reassess design decisions. Once developed to a functional stage, the team held content and functionality testing workshops with three eNGOs (WWF, BirdLife, ACF) and a design workshop with experts from that field conducive to beta testing. Based on the feedback received, the app was re-designed to accommodate requests and advice. Alpha testing of the app did not occur.

Users were presented with a home page that asked for their postcode (@fig-app-flow). The app would assign, or depending on the user's postcode, them to a CED. The user would see a species whose range intersects with the CED alongside information about that species such as its threats and geographic range. The user could cycle through the list of species associated with that CED or continue on to the how to help page. The how to help page identifies four key ways that a constituent or Australian citizen could assist threatened species within that region. -->

## Deployment and media

<!-- Accompanying the live version of the app was a media release, which was sent out to Australian local and international media outlets. Accompanying the release date (02/05/22) was a 'The Conversation" article along with efforts being made via social media to promote TA. The app creators personally messaged organisations and networks of interest asking for air time on their platforms. -->

## Data collection

<!-- We generated data from two sources: passive analytics from usage and a opt-in survey of perceived experience. Usage data was collected by embedded Google Analytics 4 on the web app during a X week period from X date to X date. Analytics data reflected usage based on the following X indicators: (1) Page views and titles, (2) Acquisition of users, (3) X something else, (4) demographics. Survey data came from a form positioned in the header of the web app (Fig X) and was comprised of four free-text answers and two likert \[?\] scale questions. We filtered out the free-text questions (not enough volume, and kinda random responses, Supplementary Material S\* \[for full table of Q/A\]), and present the quantitative answers to the following questions: Q1 "Are you going to take any actions as a result of using the web app?"; Q2 "The information on this website was easy to understand:".

## Analysis

<!-- Google Analytics data was subset to be between the 2022/05/02 and 2022/06/14.Descriptive statistics of usage etc were used to... All analyses were conducted using R and X packages. -->

## How events differentiate spatially and between pages

Every electorate around Australia received X views. These clustered here. Every how to help page received atleast X views.

```{r include=FALSE}
species_title_geom <- elects %>%
  full_join(., species_title) %>%
  group_by(electorate, state_territory, state_territory_abbrev, demographic_class) %>%
  summarise(
    active_users = sum(active_users),
    engaged_sessions = sum(engaged_sessions),
    event_count = sum(event_count)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  st_union(by_feature = TRUE)
species_title_summary <- species_title_geom %>%
  st_set_geometry(NULL)
```

<!-- An event is defined as a distinct user interaction with the TA web app such as viewing a page, scrolling, and clicking. As species were grouped by division, the CED with the most aggregated events on each species was `r species_title_summary %>% arrange(desc(event_count)) %>% select(electorate) %>% slice(1)` (`r species_title_summary %>% arrange(desc(event_count)) %>% select(state_territory_abbrev) %>% slice(1)`) with `r species_title_summary %>% arrange(desc(event_count)) %>% select(event_count) %>% slice(1)` (Figure \@ref(fig:CED-events)). In comparison, the CED with the least number of events was `r species_title_summary %>% arrange(event_count) %>% select(electorate) %>% slice(1)` (`r species_title_summary %>% arrange(event_count) %>% select(state_territory_abbrev) %>% slice(1)`) with `r species_title_summary %>% arrange(event_count) %>% select(event_count) %>% slice(1)` (Figure \@ref(fig:CED-events)).

# Discussion

## Long-term change and co-design

TA made headlines and created spikes in engagement. Whilst this is desirable, especially in the pre-election context where competition for media time was fierce, long-lasting awareness and understanding is the crown jewel of advocacy [@artsDigitalTechnologyConservation2015]. Co-design (and other principles) offer a means to achieve this.
<!-- Codesign is the way forward. It can't be rushed and isn't a linear process.
Future applications should aim for careful implementation alongside long-lasting awareness building. -->

## Transactional engagement

All modern orgs are hyper transactional and tailor the experience to the preferences of individuals. To increase the public's awareness, conservation needs to compete for attention. Conservation has a unique edge in its mission of saving species, it has the natural world ("coolness", morality, instrumentality) on its side. Given the popularity of Attenborough, Irwin, and similar there are substantial inroads to be made here. Furthermore, the vast biodiversity and research into human preferences makes tailoring digital experiences to boost engagement feasible. This is a fundamental difference that needs to be understood and capitalised on in the design of future applications.

<!-- Modern organisations (FP and NFP) have heavily invested or begun with database management/linkage that enable optimisation of services to the preferences of an individual, through such technology as recommender algorithms. This is often done on the premise that the orgnaisation has something to "sell" or that the consunmer "wants". This is not the case for conservation. Conservation is a mission-oriented movement/discipline aiming to save species. People are needed in this mission because the human and non-human are interwined. The related fields of medical science, agricultural science, climate science, etc. are all mission-oriented disciplines and have different motivations, components, and strategies for acheieveing their goals. Conservation is in a unique position to engage the populace in that it has the "coolness" of the natural world on its side. Think Attenborough, or any naturalist, doco, public awareness building. The public is not a consumer, they are a partner. This is a fundamental difference that needs to be understood and capitalised on in the design of future applications. -->

## Competition and collaboration

Particularly in conservation, organisations guard current and prospective supporters jealously. This insecurity and dedication to their own mission disables their abilities to coordinate together. As cooperation is an established foundation of human achievement, we cannot expect to bend the curve of species loss/induct further followers into the mission-oriented focus of conservation if this continues. Development of these applications should be done in collaboration with organisations, and the data needs to be shared to enable further research and development.

<!-- ### Conclusion

JW: Our efforts are a first attempt to get over a gap in the conservation space around making people aware of the challenges biodiversity faces and what they can do about it. It takes advantage of significant gains in science over the past decade documenting ranges and threats to species (cite NESP 7.7) and tries to generate information in a accessible to the general public. More is needed to get action etc and we have attempted to provide one model to bridge the knowledge-advocacy gap.

The progression of conservation science from identifying the causes to designing and implementing the solutions has been explained in this study. Whilst the key step of evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention has not been undertaken (@williamsFutureRoleConservation2020a). This represents a key step for improvement in the kind of intervention we are examining here today.

## Caveats

-   Didn't organise anything prior to app release (lol)
-   Science underlying digital tech conservation apps varies alot, our base data is rubbish
