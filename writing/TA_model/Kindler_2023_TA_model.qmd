## Target journals

**Primary:**

- [Royal Society Journals such as Interface Focus](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsfs)
  - > Reports - Reports are short, letters-style contributions of no more than 2500 words, (including references and figure captions) and up to four displays (i.e. figures and tables), of which no more than two should be figures. These articles are published rapidly and preliminary and more speculative work of high quality is strongly encouraged.
  - My understanding of letter-style is that a Discussion section is morphed into Results or non-existent

### Example/template articles

Struggling to even find Reports in Interface Focus. Seems like a combination of: 1) they do not publish Report often; 2) I think they might have changed the article naming.

Across all RSP journals, there are a few found [here](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/action/doSearch?field1=AllField&text1=environment&ConceptID=&ConceptID=&publication=&Ppub=&access=on&startPage=&ContentItemType=report).

# Abstract

Background: Many Australians experience a feeling of being connected to nature and want more action to conserve biodiversity. Yet, Australian governments have delivered inadequate policy interventions to curb losses. Pairing digital technology with biodiversity data and civic processes may support influencing policy change.

Objective: This paper describes the development process, implementation and evaluation of the Threatened Australians (TA) web app that aimed to influence policy change.

Methods: By capitalising on recent advances in data, the app aims to communicate localised snapshots of the crisis through electoral districts.

Results:

Conclusions: Examining the development, launch, and maintenance of the app helps to inform/improve future efforts.

# Introduction

## Define the context - Biodiversity loss, system-level, policy, government

Biodiversity is declining at increasingly accelerated rates. While conservation science is just one of the tools to address this problem, it does not have a good track record of translating effort into widespread/transformative change [@evansReconceptualizingRoleScience2021]. Much previously exerted effort within conservation science has been dedicated to describing the state of biodiversity and species and proximate drivers of change [@williamsFutureRoleConservation2020]. However, this information is not being translated into policy/action/change by means of a space existing between research implementation or rather knowledge and action [@toomeyNavigatingSpaceResearch2017]. A key front for improving this space is at the science-policy interface. Key solutions to some of the barriers preventing evidence-informed conservation policy are embedded in "raising awareness among the public and decision-makers regarding the long-term consequences of inaction" (Policy position, Switzerland) [@roseMajorBarriersEvidenceinformed2018]. This solution is poignant in Australia where the broader community and leaders/representatives designate insignificant attention, and consequently actions to the biodiversity crisis. We coin this awareness gap as a "social/political biodiversity crisis". This crisis manifests in that insufficient attention is applied to improving policy and providing the necessary resources to conservation is occurring within Australia. Scientist, and governance reviewers all identify these as significant constraints that we need to break down to improve conservation outcomes [@australiannationalauditoffice2022; @samuel2020; @reside2019].

## Current efforts of increasing public understanding

Whilst, this has all been acknowledged, catalysing change within this space has not been the focus of research [or advocacy efforts?]. Traditional or normal conservation science research undervalues the production of politically motivated social interventions. Conservation science is relatively connected with communities, in the last decade, social networks and digital technology has enabled large communities of citizen science to occur (e.g. iNaturalist, Zooniverse, eBird, iSpot). Citizens have become increasingly aware of the importance of monitoring biodiversity, the why behind it and have leaped at the opportunity to assist [@jolyMultimediaToolsApplications2018]. Yet, these efforts have been criticised [REF] as targeting or only attracting the ecologically minded, and thus a insignificant amount of the general population. Despite conservation being a mission-oriented discipline needing advocates and social-media buy-in, it seems to bereft of social media/digital platforms connecting people to the problem [@whitelawBiodiversityDataPublic2021]. Most public-facing ecology/conservation initiatives are focused on the needs of science (citizen-science) and the dissemination of results to managers (shiny apps), with a lack of focus on inducting broader society into the issue and encouraging advocacy for change. This has created a clear opportunity to build upon these efforts and for conservation science to begin designing models that explicity work towards addressing the barriers that exist at the science-policy interface.

## Digital technology as an intervention

Australia has one of the highest usage rates of social media/smart phone in the world [@vromenPoliticalEngagementAustralian]. Digital engagement is an integral part of young people's lives and their political interests and we know that political and social engagement is more likely to occur via online means [@vromenPoliticalEngagementAustralian]. Although disagreements of the value of digital mediums as an intervention for political engagement remain and the potential for harm/good exist, many groups now use it as a means to communicate stories and activism. Given this rise in usage (and data availability), opportunity for voices to be represented in politics is greater than ever before [@vromenPoliticalEngagementAustralian]. Given the accessibility of digital technology \[although many Aussies don't have access?\], offering a platform for engagement in the crisis is important [@jolyMultimediaToolsApplications2018].

## Explain the tool - ICT digital interventions

- Why are digital interventions important?
- Are they ubiquitous?
- What are the benefits? I.e. personalised experience

## Explain the gap - Conservation movement has neglected system-level behaviour change

## Objective/aims

We deployed an ad-hoc web-app, called "Threatened Australians" (threatened.org.au, TA) as means to experiment with adapting conservation research/efforts as a social/digital intervention. The Threatened Australians web-app operates at the interface between data-driven/science serving (typically, citizen science) platforms and political/social activism. It is the first attempt by a multidisciplinary team to provide an accessible and engaging web application aimed at raising public attention around the species crisis in Australia. The web-app was founded on aiming to provide a resource that would encourage users to engage with the problem and then offer easy means by which they can 'take action'. The primary action of the web-app was facilitating communication with local federal elected representatives via email, mimicking a tried and tested method of political participation [@vromenPoliticalEngagementAustralian]. The web-app was timed for release prior to the 2022 Australian federal election to raise attention as a electoral issue, which was seen as lacking from the platforms of the major parties [@coxWorstItEver2022]. In this paper, we describe:

3. Results of the analysis and how they inform future iterations

# Methods

## Ethics approval

This project has been reviewed by the Research Ethics and Integrity and is deemed to be exempt from ethics review under the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research and relevant University of Queensland policy (PPL 4.20.07).

## Design and development

Threatened Australians (TA) is available as a web app at a domain (threatened.org.au) through browser applications on mobile, desktop, and tablet. Development of the app begun once the core information was decided upon and gathered (see Folder SX for methodology and data information). The design of TA took on a multidisciplinary approach with regular evaluations. The development was led by a conservation science doctorate student with counsel from a conservation science professor, an interaction design expert, and a web developer. The team held an initial workshop with scientists/campaigners/organisers/strategisers from Australian environmental non-governmental organisations (eNGOs) (WWF, TNC, Invasives Species Council, Birdlife, Bush Heritage, ACF, Queensland Conservation Council) and multiple academics to receive feedback on the idea and process. This initial workshop and subsequent discussions confirmed the decision on the core function of the app. During the design and development phase, the team held meetings to describe the vision and reassess design decisions. Once developed to a functional stage, the team held content and functionality testing workshops with three eNGOs (WWF, BirdLife, ACF) and a design workshop with experts from that field conducive to beta testing. Based on the feedback received, the app was re-designed to accommodate requests and advice. Alpha testing of the app did not occur.

On initial visit to the app, users were presented with the home page which asked for their postcode. The app would assign the user to the electorate the input postcode was local to. The user would see a species whose range intersects with the CED alongside information about that species such as its threats and geographic range. The user could cycle through the list of species associated with that CED or continue on to the how to help page. The how to help page identifies four key ways that a constituent or Australian citizen could assist threatened species within that region. Other functions of TA included a Resource, a Browse (electorates), an About, and Feedback pages.

## Deployment and media

Accompanying the live version of the app was a media release, which was sent out to Australian local and international media outlets. Accompanying the release date (02/05/22) was a 'The Conversation" article along with efforts being made via social media to promote TA. The app creators personally messaged organisations and networks of interest asking for air time on their platforms.

## Data collection

We generated data from two sources: passive analytics from usage and a opt-in survey of perceived experience. Usage data was collected by embedded Google Analytics 4 on the web app during a X week period from X date to X date. Analytics data reflected usage based on the following X indicators: (1) Page views and titles, (2) Acquisition of users, (3) X something else, (4) demographics. Survey data came from a form positioned in the header of the web app (Fig X) and was comprised of four free-text answers and two likert \[?\] scale questions. We filtered out the free-text questions (not enough volume, and kinda random responses, Supplementary Material S\* \[for full table of Q/A\]), and present the quantitative answers to the following questions: Q1 "Are you going to take any actions as a result of using the web app?"; Q2 "The information on this website was easy to understand:".

## Analysis

Google Analytics data was subset to be between the 2022/05/02 and 2022/06/14.Descriptive statistics of usage etc were used to... All analyses were conducted using R and X packages.

# Results

```{r import, include=FALSE}
data_nonspatial <- load_json_data()
data_spatial <- load_spatial_data()
```

## Description of users and timing

```{r}
acquis_time_sum <- make_acquis_time_sum(data_nonspatial$acquis_time_clean)
```

```{r}
acquis_time_source <- make_acquis_time_source(data_nonspatial$acquis_time_clean)
```

The TA web application was launched on the 3rd May 2022 ahead of the Australian federal election held on the 21st May 2022. Prior to election day, `r acquis_time_sum %>% filter(between(date, as.Date("2022-05-02"), as.Date("2022-05-21"))) %>% summarise(sum = sum(sum))` (`r acquis_time_sum %>% filter(between(date, as.Date("2022-05-02"), as.Date("2022-05-21"))) %>% summarise((sum = sum(sum))/(acquis_time_sum %>% summarise(sum = sum(sum)))*100) %>% round()`%) users visited the web app (Figure \ref(fig:user-time)). The largest acquisition source of users were from `r acquis_time_source %>% select(source) %>% slice(1)` input of the TA URL into a web browser application (`r acquis_time_source %>% select(total) %>% slice(1)`, `r acquis_time_source %>% select(total_percent) %>% slice(1)`%). The Australian Broadcasting Corporation accounted for `r acquis_time_source %>% select(total) %>% slice(2)` (`r acquis_time_source %>% select(total_percent) %>% slice(2)`%) users, followed by The Conversation with `r acquis_time_source %>% select(total) %>% slice(3)` (`r acquis_time_source %>% select(total_percent) %>% slice(3)`%), Google with `r acquis_time_source %>% select(total) %>% slice(4)` (`r acquis_time_source %>% select(total_percent) %>% slice(4)`%), and Facebook `r acquis_time_source %>% select(total) %>% slice(5)` (`r acquis_time_source %>% select(total_percent) %>% slice(5)`%).

Released XXX. #% of users prior to election day. Over the course of X days up to federal election, \# Number of people and hits over time (Figure 2).

plot_engage_usage_time(data_nonspatial$acquis_time_clean)
```

## How events differentiate spatially and between pages

Every electorate around Australia received X views. These clustered here. Every how to help page received atleast X views.

```{r include=FALSE}
species_title_spatial <- mk_species_title_spatial(data_spatial$elect_clean, data_nonspatial$species_title_clean)

species_title <- species_title_spatial %>%
  st_set_geometry(NULL)
```

<!-- An event is defined as a distinct user interaction with the TA web app such as viewing a page, scrolling, and clicking. As species were grouped by division, the CED with the most aggregated events on each species was `r species_title_spatial %>% arrange(desc(event_count)) %>% select(electorate) %>% slice(1)` (`r species_title_spatial %>% arrange(desc(event_count)) %>% select(state_territory_abbrev) %>% slice(1)`) with `r species_title_spatial %>% arrange(desc(event_count)) %>% select(event_count) %>% slice(1)` (Figure \@ref(fig:CED-events)). In comparison, the CED with the least number of events was `r species_title_spatial %>% arrange(event_count) %>% select(electorate) %>% slice(1)` (`r species_title_spatial %>% arrange(event_count) %>% select(state_territory_abbrev) %>% slice(1)`) with `r species_title_spatial %>% arrange(event_count) %>% select(event_count) %>% slice(1)` (Figure \@ref(fig:CED-events)).

Australian CEDs contain an average of X people. You can see here that it is not an even distribution of our users. -->

```{r}
#| label: fig-CED-events
#| fig-cap: Choropleth map of Australian Commonwealth Electoral Divisions (CEDs) and the aggregate number of events recorded on the species profile pages

# I tried to do by city but this was unsuccessful as it didn't capture a lot, it kinda makes sense to do it via how we structured the app
# Two options:
# A) Could do one chart of sum species page view per electorate then
# B) sum how to help page per electorate

plot_ced_events(species_title_spatial)
```

## How events differentiate between species

There were X number of threatened animals. There were X number of threatened plants. Every animal species in every electorate received at least X views. Number of species investigated and most popular species were XXX.
