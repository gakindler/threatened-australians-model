## Target journals

**Primary:**

- [Royal Society Journals such as Interface Focus](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsfs)
  - > Reports - Reports are short, letters-style contributions of no more than 2500 words, (including references and figure captions) and up to four displays (i.e. figures and tables), of which no more than two should be figures. These articles are published rapidly and preliminary and more speculative work of high quality is strongly encouraged.
  - My understanding of letter-style is that a Discussion section is morphed into Results or non-existent

### Example/template articles

Struggling to even find Reports in Interface Focus. Seems like a combination of: 1) they do not publish Report often; 2) I think they might have changed the article naming.

Across all RSP journals, there are a few found [here](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/action/doSearch?field1=AllField&text1=environment&ConceptID=&ConceptID=&publication=&Ppub=&access=on&startPage=&ContentItemType=report).

# Abstract

Background: Many Australians experience a feeling of being connected to nature and want more action to conserve biodiversity. Yet, Australian governments have delivered inadequate policy interventions to curb losses. Pairing digital technology with biodiversity data and civic processes may support influencing policy change.

Objective: This paper describes the development process, implementation and evaluation of the Threatened Australians (TA) web app that aimed to influence policy change.

Methods: By capitalising on recent advances in data, the app aims to communicate localised snapshots of the crisis through electoral districts.

Results:

Conclusions: Examining the development, launch, and maintenance of the app helps to inform/improve future efforts.

# Introduction

## Define the context - Biodiversity loss, system-level, policy, government

## Explain the tool - ICT digital interventions

- Why are digital interventions important?
- Are they ubiquitous?
- What are the benefits? I.e. personalised experience

## Explain the gap - Conservation movement has neglected system-level behaviour change

## Objective/aims

We deployed an ad-hoc web-app, called "Threatened Australians" (threatened.org.au, TA) as means to experiment with adapting conservation research/efforts as a social/digital intervention. The Threatened Australians web-app operates at the interface between data-driven/science serving (typically, citizen science) platforms and political/social activism. It is the first attempt by a multidisciplinary team to provide an accessible and engaging web application aimed at raising public attention around the species crisis in Australia. The web-app was founded on aiming to provide a resource that would encourage users to engage with the problem and then offer easy means by which they can 'take action'. The primary action of the web-app was facilitating communication with local federal elected representatives via email, mimicking a tried and tested method of political participation [@vromenPoliticalEngagementAustralian]. The web-app was timed for release prior to the 2022 Australian federal election to raise attention as a electoral issue, which was seen as lacking from the platforms of the major parties [@coxWorstItEver2022]. In this paper, we describe:

1. Our design and development process
2. Analysis of the analytics and feedback data collected
3. Results of the analysis and how they inform future iterations

# Methods

## Ethics approval

This project has been reviewed by the Research Ethics and Integrity and is deemed to be exempt from ethics review under the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research and relevant University of Queensland policy (PPL 4.20.07).

## Design and development

Threatened Australians (TA) is available as a web app at a domain (threatened.org.au) through browser applications on mobile, desktop, and tablet. Development of the app begun once the core information was decided upon and gathered (see Folder SX for methodology and data information). The design of TA took on a multidisciplinary approach with regular evaluations. The development was led by a conservation science doctorate student with counsel from a conservation science professor, an interaction design expert, and a web developer. The team held an initial workshop with scientists/campaigners/organisers/strategisers from Australian environmental non-governmental organisations (eNGOs) (WWF, TNC, Invasives Species Council, Birdlife, Bush Heritage, ACF, Queensland Conservation Council) and multiple academics to receive feedback on the idea and process. This initial workshop and subsequent discussions confirmed the decision on the core function of the app. During the design and development phase, the team held meetings to describe the vision and reassess design decisions. Once developed to a functional stage, the team held content and functionality testing workshops with three eNGOs (WWF, BirdLife, ACF) and a design workshop with experts from that field conducive to beta testing. Based on the feedback received, the app was re-designed to accommodate requests and advice. Alpha testing of the app did not occur.

On initial visit to the app, users were presented with the home page which asked for their postcode. The app would assign the user to the electorate the input postcode was local to. The user would see a species whose range intersects with the CED alongside information about that species such as its threats and geographic range. The user could cycle through the list of species associated with that CED or continue on to the how to help page. The how to help page identifies four key ways that a constituent or Australian citizen could assist threatened species within that region. Other functions of TA included a Resource, a Browse (electorates), an About, and Feedback pages.

## Deployment and media

TA was timed for release prior to the 2022 Australian federal election to raise attention as a electoral issue, which was seen as lacking from the platforms of the major parties [@coxWorstItEver2022]. Accompanying the live version of the app was a media release, an article in The Conversation, and effort within personal networks to receive airtime.

## Data collection

We generated data from two sources: passive analytics from usage and a opt-in survey of perceived experience. Usage data was collected by embedded Google Analytics 4 on the web app during a X week period from X date to X date. Analytics data reflected usage based on the following X indicators: (1) Page views and titles, (2) Acquisition of users, (3) X something else, (4) demographics. Survey data came from a form positioned in the header of the web app (Fig X) and was comprised of four free-text answers and two likert \[?\] scale questions. We filtered out the free-text questions (not enough volume, and kinda random responses, Supplementary Material S\* \[for full table of Q/A\]), and present the quantitative answers to the following questions: Q1 "Are you going to take any actions as a result of using the web app?"; Q2 "The information on this website was easy to understand:".
